[Diagram Expand](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-BBP3UprFf-diagram-expand) was developed to assist users in enhancing the abstraction level of their architectural diagrams. Its primary function is to guide users in simplifying, generalizing, and abstracting their diagrams to emphasize high-level concepts and relationships rather than intricate details. By focusing on overarching structures and connections, Diagram Expand helps users create more comprehensible and manageable representations of complex systems, making it easier to convey core ideas and strategic visions.

Through a step-by-step, multiple-choice process, Diagram Expand interacts with users to understand their specific needs and objectives. Users can upload plain text diagrams, and Diagram Expand then provides tailored advice on how to elevate the abstraction level of these diagrams. By transforming detailed components into broader categories and highlighting essential interactions, this tool streamlines the visualization of complex architectures, fostering better communication and understanding among stakeholders.
